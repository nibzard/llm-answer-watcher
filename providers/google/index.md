## Basic Configuration

### Without Google Search Grounding

Standard Gemini usage with training data only:

```yaml
models:
  - provider: "google"
    model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
    env_api_key: "GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

**Use when**:

- You don't need real-time information
- Faster response times are critical
- Cost optimization is priority

### With Google Search Grounding

Enable real-time web information:

```yaml
models:
  - provider: "google"
    model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash"
    env_api_key: "GEMINI_API_KEY"
    system_prompt: "google/gemini-grounding"
    tools:
      - google_search: {}
```

**Use when**:

- Brand monitoring requires current data
- Tracking real-time competitive landscape
- Need to detect recent changes
- Want Google's search quality

## Google Search Grounding

### Configuration Format

Google uses a unique tools configuration format:

```yaml
tools:
  - google_search: {}  # Dictionary with tool name as key
```

This differs from OpenAI's format:

```yaml
tools:
  - type: "web_search"  # Dictionary with 'type' field
tool_choice: "auto"
```

**Why the difference?** Each provider has different API specifications. Google uses named tool objects, OpenAI uses typed specifications. The config does direct passthrough to each API.

### Supported Models for Grounding

| Model                   | Grounding Support            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `gemini-2.5-flash`      | ✅ **Yes** (recommended)     |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | ❌ No                        |
| `gemini-2.5-pro`        | ✅ **Yes** (highest quality) |
| `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`  | ⚠️ Experimental              |
| `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` | ❌ No                        |

### System Prompt Optimization

Use the specialized `google/gemini-grounding` system prompt for best results:

```yaml
models:
  - provider: "google"
    model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash"
    env_api_key: "GEMINI_API_KEY"
    system_prompt: "google/gemini-grounding"  # Optimized for grounding
    tools:
      - google_search: {}
```

This prompt:

- Instructs Gemini to use Google Search when beneficial
- Emphasizes grounding responses in search results
- Requests comprehensive source coverage
- Improves answer quality for brand monitoring

### How Grounding Works

1. Gemini receives your query prompt
1. **Automatically decides** if Google Search would improve the answer
1. Performs search if beneficial (no `tool_choice` parameter needed)
1. Grounds response in search results
1. Returns answer with grounding metadata

**No explicit control**: Unlike OpenAI's `tool_choice: "required"`, Gemini intelligently determines when grounding helps. This is intentional - Gemini optimizes for quality and cost.

### Grounding Metadata

Responses include rich grounding attribution:

```json
{
  "web_search_results": {
    "web_search_queries": ["best email warmup tools 2025"],
    "grounding_chunks": [
      {
        "web_source": "https://www.g2.com/categories/email-warmup",
        "retrieved_context": "Top email warmup tools..."
      }
    ],
    "grounding_supports": [
      {
        "segment": {
          "text": "Warmly is a leading solution"
        },
        "grounding_chunk_indices": [0],
        "confidence_scores": [0.95]
      }
    ]
  },
  "web_search_count": 1
}
```

**Key fields**:

- `web_search_queries`: What Gemini searched for
- `grounding_chunks`: Source URLs and context
- `grounding_supports`: Which text segments came from which sources
- `confidence_scores`: How confident Gemini is (0.0-1.0)

## Pricing

### Token Costs

| Model                   | Input             | Output            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `gemini-2.5-flash`      | $0.04 / 1M tokens | $0.12 / 1M tokens |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | $0.02 / 1M tokens | $0.06 / 1M tokens |
| `gemini-2.5-pro`        | $0.60 / 1M tokens | $1.80 / 1M tokens |

### Google Search Grounding Costs

**Good news**: No additional fees for grounding. You only pay token costs.

**Example** (email warmup query with grounding):

```text
Input: 100 tokens @ $0.04/1M = $0.000004
Output: 300 tokens @ $0.12/1M = $0.000036
Total: $0.00004 per query
```

**Comparison**:

- **Gemini with grounding**: $0.00004 per query
- **OpenAI web search**: $0.0116 per query (~290x more)
- **Perplexity sonar-pro**: (0.005-)0.03 per query (125-750x more)

Cost Advantage

Google Search grounding is **significantly cheaper** than alternatives. Grounding tokens are included in base pricing with no per-request fees.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Appropriate Model Tiers

```yaml
# High-volume, non-grounded queries
- model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"

# Production brand monitoring (recommended)
- model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash"
  tools: [google_search: {}]

# Premium quality for critical queries
- model_name: "gemini-2.5-pro"
  tools: [google_search: {}]
```

### 2. Enable Grounding for Brand Monitoring

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD - Grounding for current brand data
- provider: "google"
  model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash"
  system_prompt: "google/gemini-grounding"
  tools:
    - google_search: {}

intents:
  - id: "current-tools"
    prompt: "What are the best email tools in 2025?"
```

### 3. Skip Grounding for Historical/Generic Queries

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD - No grounding for general knowledge
- provider: "google"
  model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"

intents:
  - id: "email-best-practices"
    prompt: "What are email deliverability best practices?"
```

### 4. Use Grounding-Optimized System Prompt

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD
system_prompt: "google/gemini-grounding"  # Optimized

# ❌ SUBOPTIMAL
# (no system_prompt or using "google/default")
```

### 5. Monitor Grounding Usage

Track when Gemini uses grounding:

```python
# Check if grounding was used
if result["web_search_count"] > 0:
    print(f"Grounding used: {result['web_search_count']} searches")
    print(f"Queries: {result['web_search_results']['web_search_queries']}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Grounding Not Working

**Problem**: `web_search_count` is always 0

**Solutions**:

1. Check you're using a grounding-capable model:

```yaml
# ✅ Grounding supported
model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash"

# ❌ Grounding NOT supported
model_name: "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
```

1. Verify tools configuration format:

   ```yaml
   # ✅ Correct
   tools:
     - google_search: {}

   # ❌ Wrong (OpenAI format)
   tools:
     - type: "web_search"
   ```

1. Use grounding-optimized system prompt:

   ```yaml
   system_prompt: "google/gemini-grounding"
   ```

### API Authentication Errors

**Problem**: `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`

**Solutions**:

1. Verify API key is correct:

```bash
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY  # Should show AIza...
```

1. Check key is active in [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
1. Verify key has correct permissions

### Rate Limiting

**Problem**: `429 Too Many Requests`

**Solutions**:

1. Reduce `max_concurrent_requests` in config:

```yaml
run_settings:
  max_concurrent_requests: 3  # Google limit
```

1. Add delay between requests
1. Upgrade to higher quota tier in AI Studio
