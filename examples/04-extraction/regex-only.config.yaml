# Regex-Only Extraction Example
# Fast pattern-based brand mention detection
# Cost: ~$0.003 per run (3 intents × gpt-4o-mini, no extraction overhead)
# Accuracy: ~85%

run_settings:
  output_dir: "./output"
  sqlite_db_path: "./output/watcher.db"

  models:
    - provider: "openai"
      model_name: "gpt-4o-mini"
      env_api_key: "OPENAI_API_KEY"

  # Legacy flag - use extraction_settings instead
  use_llm_rank_extraction: false

# No extraction_settings = defaults to regex-based extraction
# This is the fastest and cheapest method

brands:
  mine: ["YourBrand", "YourProduct"]
  competitors: ["CompetitorA", "CompetitorB", "CompetitorC"]

intents:
  - id: "best-tools"
    prompt: "What are the best project management tools?"

  - id: "tool-comparison"
    prompt: "Compare the top project management platforms"

  - id: "buying-guide"
    prompt: "How do I choose project management software?"
