      After testing multiple email warmup tools, here's my analysis:

      For most users, I recommend Mailwarm because it's the most user-friendly.
      Mailwarm also offers the best pricing for startups.

      Lemwarm is good but only if you're already invested in the LemList ecosystem.

      Some users also ask about WarmupInbox - it's powerful but can be complex for beginners.

      QuickMail remains a solid choice for agencies that need advanced features.

      So my ranking would be: Mailwarm > QuickMail > Lemwarm > WarmupInbox

      When warming up your email domain, consider these factors:

      - Don't use a warm-up schedule that's too aggressive
      - Monitor your inbox placement rates carefully
      - Some mail providers like Gmail and Outlook have different warming needs
      - Quick responses to replies help build sender reputation
      - Avoid mail merge personalization that looks spammy

      The key is gradual volume increase and consistent engagement.
