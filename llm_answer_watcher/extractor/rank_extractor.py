Rank extraction for LLM Answer Watcher.

This module extracts ranked lists of brands/tools from LLM responses.
It supports pattern-based extraction (default) and optional LLM-assisted
extraction for more accurate rankings.

Pattern-based extraction looks for:
- Numbered lists: 1. ToolName, 2. ToolName
- Bullet lists: - ToolName, " ToolName
- Markdown headers: ## ToolName

LLM-assisted extraction (optional, v1 stub):
- Makes a second LLM call to extract structured rankings
- More accurate for conversational responses
- Disabled by default (cost/latency tradeoff)

Key features:
- Word-boundary matching to avoid false positives
- Fuzzy matching against known brands
- Confidence scoring (1.0 = clear numbered list, 0.3 = no structure)
- First-seen deduplication

Example:
    >>> known_brands = ["Warmly", "HubSpot", "Instantly"]
    >>> text = "1. Warmly\\n2. HubSpot\\n3. Instantly"
    >>> ranked, confidence = extract_ranked_list_pattern(text, known_brands)
    >>> ranked[0].brand_name
    'Warmly'
    >>> ranked[0].rank_position
    1
    >>> confidence
    1.0
